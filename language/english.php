        This is the place to register your glider, towplane or other FLARM/OGN-equipped aircraft
        to the Open Glider Network. Registering has several advantages:
        <ul>
            <li>You can influence how your glider is displayed on
                <a href='http://live.glidernet.org'>live.glidernet.org</a> and other tracking sites</li>
            <li>In case of SAR, your glider may be easier to find</li>
            <li>You contribute to traffic-awareness among other pilots and ATC</li>
